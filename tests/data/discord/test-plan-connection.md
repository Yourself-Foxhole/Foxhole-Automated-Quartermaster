## Test Plan: Connection Management (TDD)

### Purpose
To ensure the Discord bot reliably connects, maintains, and gracefully handles its connection to Discord, as described in the user story.

### Test Cases

#### 1. Bot Startup Connection
- **Test:** When the bot starts, it should attempt to connect to Discord.
- **Arrange:** Mock Discord API and bot token.
- **Act:** Start the bot.
- **Assert:** Verify connection method is called and a successful connection event is logged.

#### 2. Automatic Reconnection
- **Test:** If the connection is lost, the bot should attempt to reconnect automatically.
- **Arrange:** Simulate a network interruption or forced disconnect.
- **Act:** Observe bot behavior after disconnect.
- **Assert:** Verify reconnection attempts and that reconnection events are logged.

#### 3. Authentication Error Handling
- **Test:** The bot should handle authentication errors gracefully.
- **Arrange:** Provide an invalid or expired token.
- **Act:** Start the bot.
- **Assert:** Verify error is logged and administrator is notified (if implemented).

#### 4. Graceful Shutdown
- **Test:** The bot should disconnect gracefully on shutdown.
- **Arrange:** Start the bot and connect to Discord.
- **Act:** Trigger a shutdown or restart.
- **Assert:** Verify disconnect method is called and disconnection event is logged.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All tests above must pass before feature is considered complete.
- Tests should be automated and run as part of CI/CD pipeline.

### Notes
- Use mocking frameworks to simulate Discord API responses and network conditions.
- Log outputs should be captured and asserted in tests.
- Consider edge cases such as repeated failures, rate limits, and partial outages.
