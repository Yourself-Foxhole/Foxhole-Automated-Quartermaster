# Discord Bot Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for the Discord bot portion of the Foxhole Automated Quartermaster project, following the 4-layer architecture described in the project documentation.

---

## 1. Model Layer
- **Database ORM (Peewee):**
  - Test CRUD operations for inventory, tasks, and unit states.
  - Validate database connection and schema migrations.
- **Discord Presence (disnake):**
  - Verify bot can connect, disconnect, and reconnect to Discord.
  - Test presence/status updates and event handling.

## 2. Service Layer
- **Graph Processing:**
  - Validate creation, update, and deletion of nodes and edges.
- **State Management:**
  - Ensure correct state transitions for units and inventory.
- **Queries:**
  - Confirm accurate data retrieval and filtering.
- **OCR Integration:**
  - Mock FIR responses and validate OCR data handling.

## 3. Data Pipeline
- **Screenshot Parsing:**
  - Simulate image input and verify correct parsing to FIR data.
- **Event-Driven Updates:**
  - Ensure events trigger correct service calls and updates.
- **Batch Analysis:**
  - Validate inventory delta and production target calculations.

## 4. Presentation Layer
- **Message Formatting:**
  - Ensure dashboards, task boards, and embeds are correctly generated.
- **Command Handling:**
  - Validate responses to commands, button presses, and reactions.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Confirm appropriate error messages and fallback behaviors.

## 5. Integration Tests
- Simulate end-to-end flows:
  - Screenshot upload → OCR → Inventory update → Dashboard post.
  - User command → Service query → Message/Embed response.
- Test concurrency and event ordering.
- Test permission and access control for Discord commands.

## 6. Edge Cases & Negative Tests
- Invalid or corrupted image uploads.
- Database or Discord connection failures.
- Unexpected user input or command misuse.

## 7. Performance & Reliability
- Test bot responsiveness under load.
- Test recovery from service interruptions.


This plan covers unit, integration, and system-level tests for the Discord bot, ensuring reliability across all architectural layers.
