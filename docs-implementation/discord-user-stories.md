This file should contain user stories and other planning tools for implementation of a certain part of the project.


## Discord Data Layer

This set of features is effectively our front end. This layer handles pure interaction with the discord service.

Features:

* Connect and maintain a connection to discord
* Be able to create multiple channels and threads
* Be able to listen for commands
* Be able to post embeds, the primary post type
* Be able to update dashboard posts with current information
* Be able to parse screenshots, downloading them to handoff to the data layer
* Be able to update and manage reactions on posts
* Be able to crosspost updates between channels where needed


## User Stories

### Connection

Feature: The Bot manages a connection to Discord.

As a user,
I want the bot to maintain a constant and reliable connection to the Discord service,
So that I can always interact with it and receive timely updates.

#### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Bot starts and connects to Discord**
- Given the bot is started
- When the bot initializes
- Then it should establish a connection to the Discord API
- And log a successful connection event

**Scenario 2: Bot maintains connection**
- Given the bot is running
- When the Discord connection is interrupted (e.g., network issue)
- Then the bot should attempt to automatically reconnect
- And log reconnection attempts and results

**Scenario 3: Bot handles authentication errors**
- Given the bot is running
- When the Discord API returns an authentication error
- Then the bot should log the error
- And notify the administrator if possible

**Scenario 4: Bot disconnects gracefully**
- Given the bot is running
- When the bot is intentionally stopped or restarted
- Then it should disconnect from Discord gracefully
- And log the disconnection event

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The bot must connect to Discord on startup and log the event.
- The bot must attempt to reconnect automatically if disconnected unexpectedly.
- The bot must handle and log authentication or connection errors.
- The bot must disconnect gracefully on shutdown.
