Player facilities introduce a large amount of complexity for the following reasons:

* Facilities include a high number of buildings, each with their own stockpiles
* Facilities may include duplicates of the same building type
* Facility production often involves significant more intermediate products
* Facility tasks involve moving things between different buildings over short distances, making them high repetition but low complexity tasks
* Facility storage is often difficult or complicated, with items being spread between the buildings and not collected until it leaves the facility
* Facilities require power, meaning production may go offline if power supply is disrupted
* Facilities require Maintenance Supplies, meaning that the facility may decay if not supplied
* Facilities have different designs and are not common with different production goals

## Appraoch to Facilities

Instead of trying to generate tasks for facilities we instead approach the idea of a facility as a single entity.
