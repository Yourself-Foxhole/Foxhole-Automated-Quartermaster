Frontline Delivery involves the actual use and consumption of items, but it also includes the highest risk overall for logistics.

## Delivery Destinations

Frontline destinations are split up by both their actual definitions by the game's developers, how much effort the team as a whole is willing to put into a given frontline base, and practical or strategic uses made by the game's player base.

In terms of the game developers, destinations break down as follows:

* World Structures
  * Description
    * Include pre-placed goals or objectives
    * Often include high HP, high resistance points
    * Actually control Map Locations
    * Serve as the "Center" of the map and as important strategic locations for control of a hex
  * Types
    * Town Hall
    * Relic Base
* Player structures
  * Bunker Base
    * Bunker bases are the main defensive lines
  * Encampment
    * Built easily and quickly but does not have the same amount of tech as a full bunker base.
  * Ship
    * Longhook - Mobile Bunker Base
    * Bluefin - Mobile Storage Depot
