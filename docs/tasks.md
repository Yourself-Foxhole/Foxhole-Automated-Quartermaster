# Task Layer Specification

## Rationale
Orders generated by the graph network are often too granular and numerous to present 
directly to users. Displaying raw orders can overwhelm users and reduce engagement. 
A task layer aggregates, prioritizes, and contextualizes these orders, presenting 
actionable units that improve clarity and usability.

## Relationship Between Orders and Tasks
- **Orders**: Represent granular requirements or actions needed by the system
    (e.g., move 10 Bmats from A to B).
- **Tasks**: Aggregate and contextualize orders into actionable suggestions for
  users (e.g., "Deliver all Bmats to Factory").
- **User Interactions**: Users interact with tasks, not raw orders. The bot 
 communicates tasks, and users execute them in-game.

## Task Generation and Management
- **Aggregation**: Orders are merged into tasks based on location, type, and context.
 For example, all production orders at a factory can be combined into a single task.
- **Prioritization**: Tasks are sorted by urgency, impact, and feasibility.
  Criteria may include supply shortages, strategic importance, or available resources.
- **Filtering**: Tasks that are currently impossible (e.g., lack required resources or access) are hidden. Tasks can also be filtered by type (production, delivery, etc.) or location.
- **Opportunistic Tasks**: If extra capacity (e.g., truck space or labor) is available,
  additional tasks may be suggested even if not strictly required.

## Presentation Guidelines
- **Clarity**: Tasks should be described in clear, actionable language.
- **Contextualization**: Only show tasks relevant to the user's current location or role.
- **Manageability**: Limit the number of visible tasks to avoid overwhelming users.
 Use grouping and summarization where possible.
- **Interactivity**: Allow users to sort and filter tasks by priority, type, or location.

## Edge Cases and Extensibility
- **Synchronization**: Ensure tasks stay up-to-date with underlying orders and inventory state.
- **Dynamic Updates**: As game state changes, tasks should be regenerated and reprioritized.
- **Extensibility**: The task system should support new types of tasks and aggregation logic as requirements evolve.

## Example Workflow
1. Graph network generates orders based on supply/demand.
2. Task layer aggregates and prioritizes orders into tasks.
3. Bot presents tasks to users, filtered by context.
4. Users select and execute tasks in-game.
5. Task completion updates inventory and order state, triggering regeneration of tasks.

## Types of Tasks

1. Transportation: Transport between nodes, if available
2. Production: Manufacturing or making of items
3. Resource: Scrooping to fuel the entire thing is counted differently than production.
4. Facility: Tasks built around facilities
5. Maintenance: These are time based tasks, refresh reservations, do maintenance supplies, etc.
6. User: Things that end users want us to do out side of the production system. 
7. Event: These may be triggered based on something happening in the game (like border bases, or death rate spike, invasion, or partisans)

This specification provides a foundation for implementing the task layer, ensuring user interactions are clear, 
actionable, and manageable while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
