The game presents a faction technology tree. The game starts out with very basic items (only rifles unlocked) and as the war progresses more and more technology gets unlocked.

The game has two tech trees, one for vehicles and the other for everything else.

The inventory system should maintain a list of tech for items and allow the tech level to be set. Additionally a future feature is expected to be implemented wherein someone can upload a screenshot of the technology screen and the percentage progress and ETA can be calculated based on the time interval from the last few screenshots.
