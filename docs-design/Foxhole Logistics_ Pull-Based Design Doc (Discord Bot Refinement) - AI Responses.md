## **Foxhole Logistics System Design: Pull-Based Model for Hex Superiority (Discord Bot Refinement)**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow. The bot manages tasks for **Midline/Backline production (at Factories and Mass Production Factories \- MPFs) and transportation** feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots), as well as **Frontline (Last Mile) distribution** from those hubs to specific **Forward Bases** (Bunker Bases, FOBs). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs and Forward Bases trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot. This system functions analogously to a buffered reader, pulling data (supplies) through different stages via a task system. We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics Steps:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition to delivery at Forward Bases, accounting for different production methods (Factory/MPF).  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs generate prioritized production (Factory/MPF specific) and transport tasks within Discord.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (using standardized FTL/FCL values and considering Factory/MPF batching incentives), and ensure high availability of critical resources via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring Frontline Staging Hubs and Forward Bases are consistently supplied.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system via Discord, improving coordination, resource allocation, guiding players, and managing the distinct workflows for Factory and MPF production.

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant Stages for Bot)**

1. **Resource Acquisition (State: RAW)** \- *Prerequisite.*  
2. **Material Refining (State: PROCESSED)** \- *Prerequisite.*  
3. **Manufacturing Queued (State: QUEUED\_PROD)** \- Submitting a production order at a **Factory** or **MPF**. Managed by Bot Task (location specified).  
4. **Manufacturing Pickup (State: PRODUCT\_READY)** \- Retrieving finished crates from **Factory** or **MPF**. Managed by Bot Task.  
5. **Storage & Staging (State: BUFFERED/CACHED)** \- Hubs act as sources/destinations.  
6. **Bulk Transportation (State: INTER-HEX TRANSIT)** \- Managed by Bot Tasks (FTL/FCL quantities). Context: Single shippables/containers, Ironships (5), Trains (\~13).  
7. **Delivery to Frontline Hub (State: STAGED)** \- Endpoint for bulk transport, source for last-mile.  
8. **Last-Mile Transportation (State: INTRA-HEX TRANSIT)** \- Managed by Bot Tasks (FTL quantities).  
9. Delivery to Forward Base (State: DELIVERED\_FRONT) \- Endpoint for bot-managed tasks.  
   (Consumption is outside this bot's scope)

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs into actionable, prioritized tasks, differentiating between Factory and MPF production. FTL (Full Truck Load) \= **15 crates**. FCL (Full Container Load) \= **60 crates**.

* **Level 1 Pull: Forward Base Demand (Last Mile)**  
  * *(Trigger/Bot Action largely unchanged, generates TRANSPORT\_LAST\_MILE tasks)*  
* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bulk Supply)**  
  * *(Trigger/Bot Action largely unchanged, calculates deficit, triggers Level 3, performs Critical Ping Check)*  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Task Generation (Production/Transport)**  
  * **Trigger:** Quantified need (deficit) calculated at Level 2\.  
  * **Bot Action (Task Creation & Prioritization):**  
    1. **Prioritization:** Assign priority score (Item Type, Deficit Severity, Urgency Flag).  
    2. **Check Backline Stock:** Attempt to find needed crates in reported backline hub stocks.  
    3. **Generate TRANSPORT Task:** If sufficient stock found, create TRANSPORT task.  
    4. **Determine Production Location (If No Stock):**  
       * **Factory Mandatory:** If Item is Engineering or Medical category.  
       * **MPF Mandatory:** If Item is Vehicle or Structure category.  
       * **Player Choice/Default (Other Items):**  
         * If Urgency=High or deficit is small (\< 3-5 crates), lean towards **Factory**.  
         * Otherwise (standard urgency, larger deficits), default to **MPF** to leverage discounts and long-term planning.  
    5. **Generate QUEUE\_PRODUCTION Task:**  
       * **If Factory:** Create QUEUE\_PRODUCTION task for Factory. Batch size up to 4 crates per task (reflecting queue limits). Task quantity based on deficit up to 4\. Multiple tasks may be generated if deficit \> 4\.  
       * **If MPF:** Create QUEUE\_PRODUCTION task for MPF. **Batch size is always 5 crates** (or multiples of 5 if deficit is very large) to maximize discount. Task quantity is fixed at 5 (or multiple). *Note: May slightly overproduce small deficits, but optimizes cost.* Specify target location as MPF.  
    6. **Feasibility Notice:** Provide warning if request priority is low relative to queue depth.  
    7. **Add to Queue:** Add generated task(s). Handle duplicates.  
* **Level 4: Production Completion & Pickup**  
  * **Trigger (Factory):** User marks QUEUE\_PRODUCTION (Factory) task complete via \!tasks complete \[TaskID\].  
  * **Trigger (MPF):** CurrentTime \>= EstimatedCompletionTime for a claimed QUEUE\_PRODUCTION (MPF) task.  
  * **Bot Action:**  
    1. Mark the QUEUE\_PRODUCTION task as COMPLETE.  
    2. Generate PICKUP\_PRODUCTION task: PICKUP\_PRODUCTION \[Qty\]x\[Item\] from \[Factory/MPF\_Location\]. Destination is typically a nearby Backline Hub. Assign priority. Link to the original queue task ID.  
    3. **MPF Completion Notification:** If the completed task was MPF, ping the configured role (\!config set\_mpf\_complete\_ping).  
    4. Add PICKUP\_PRODUCTION task to the queue.

**5\. Discord Bot Implementation Details**

* **A. Command Interface:** (Expanded & Refined Details)  
  * \!config set\_task\_timeout \[DurationHours\] \- (Admin) Sets global task claim timeout.  
  * \!config set\_mpf\_complete\_ping \[Role\] \- (Admin) Sets the role to ping when an MPF production run finishes. *Example:* \!config set\_mpf\_complete\_ping @MPF\_Pickup\_Crew  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_buffer \[Item\] \[TargetQty\] \- (Admin) Sets target stock level.  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_item\_priority \[Item\] \[PriorityScore\] \[DefaultProd=MPF/Factory\] \[TransportLoad=FTL/FCL\] \- (Admin) Sets item priority, default production location choice (for eligible items), and typical bulk transport load type.  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_critical\_ping \[Item\] \[ThresholdPercent\] \[Role/User\] \- (Admin) Configures critical stock alerts.  
  * \!stock report \[HubNameOrBaseName\] \[--source FrontlineHubName\] \[Item1\]=\[Qty1\] ... \- (User) Reports stock levels.  
  * \!request \[HubNameOrBaseName\] \[--source FrontlineHubName\] \[Item1\]=\[Qty1\] ... \[Urgency=Low/Med/High\] \[--prefer Factory/MPF\] \- (User) Requests items. Optional \--prefer flag influences production location choice for eligible items.  
  * \!tasks list \[HubName (Optional)\] \[--type TaskType\] \[--loc Factory/MPF\] \- (User) Shows open tasks, with optional filtering by type or production location. *Output now indicates Factory/MPF for production tasks and estimated completion for MPF queues.*  
  * \!tasks find \[Activity\] \[HubName (Optional)\] \- (User) Helps find tasks. Activities updated slightly: transport\_ftl, transport\_fcl, transport\_vehicle (groups tasks for containers/shippables), production\_factory\_\[Item\], production\_mpf\_\[Item\], pickup\_factory, pickup\_mpf. transport\_ironship/transport\_train could show groups of FCL tasks to nearby hubs as a potential enhancement.  
  * \!tasks claim \[TaskID\] \- (User) Claims task. Sets timeout.  
  * \!tasks update \[TaskID\] set\_completion\_time \[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\] \- (User, must be claimer) **Crucial for MPF:** Allows user who claimed QUEUE\_PRODUCTION (MPF) task to input the actual estimated completion time from the in-game UI. This updates the EstimatedCompletionTime for the task.  
  * \!tasks complete \[TaskID\] \- (User, must be claimer) Marks task done. **Primarily used for non-MPF-queue tasks** (Transport, Pickup, Factory Queues). Triggers PICKUP\_PRODUCTION generation for completed Factory queues.  
  * \!tasks abandon \[TaskID\] \- (User, must be claimer) Releases task.  
  * \!production calc \[Item\] \[Qty\] \[--loc Factory/MPF\] \- (User) Calculates material cost, noting MPF discounts are applied implicitly for MPF calculations (maybe show base vs discounted cost).  
  * \!status \[HubNameOrBaseName\] \- (User) Shows health status (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢) and task summary.  
  * \!dashboard \- (User) High-level overview: Top priority tasks, network flow summary (tasks completed, crates moved/produced), critical hub alerts.  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:** Handles Factory/MPF distinction.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Adds ProductionLocationType (Factory/MPF) and EstimatedCompletionTime fields to Tasks.  
  * Background process checks for task timeouts AND MPF completion times (CurrentTime \>= EstimatedCompletionTime).  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * **Factory/MPF Decision:** Implements logic described in Section 4\. Considers item type, urgency, quantity, \--prefer flag, and configured defaults.  
  * **Batching:** Factory tasks up to 4 crates. MPF tasks always 5 crates (or multiples) for items produced there.  
  * **MPF Timing:** Relies on user input via \!tasks update ... set\_completion\_time for accuracy. Auto-completes queue task and generates pickup task based on this time. Notifies designated role.  
  * **Transport Context:** Bot generates tasks for FTL (15) / FCL (60) crates. Players use \!tasks find to identify tasks suitable for specific transport methods (trucks, flatbeds, containers, potentially grouping for freighters/trains).  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:** Feasibility notices remain. MPF's high cost/time encourages planning.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * Hubs: (HubName, LocationType ...)  
  * HubStockStatus: (HubName, Item, TargetBufferQty, CurrentQty, ReportTimestamp, ReportedByUserID, CriticalThresholdPercent, PingRoleOrUser)  
  * ItemPriorities: (Item, PriorityScore, DefaultProdLocation // Factory/MPF, DefaultTransportLoad // FTL/FCL)  
  * Tasks: (TaskID, TargetHub, TaskType, Item, Quantity, PriorityScore, Status, ClaimedByUserID, SourceLocation, CreatedAt, CompletedAt, ClaimTimeoutTimestamp, LinkedQueueTaskID, **ProductionLocationType** // Factory/MPF, **EstimatedCompletionTime** // For MPF)  
  * Recipes: (OutputItem, OutputQty, InputItem, InputQty, **ProductionLocation** // Factory/MPF/Both)  
  * GlobalConfig: (SettingName, Value // e.g., TaskTimeoutHours, MPFCompletionPingRole)

**6\. Information Flow & Communication (Bot Mediated)**

Bot orchestrates flow, differentiating Factory/MPF paths, providing timed alerts for MPF completions.

**7\. Optimization Strategies (Bot Enabled)**

* Leverages MPF discounts via batching.  
* Directs urgent needs to faster Factories.  
* Provides visibility into distinct production pipelines.

**8\. Metrics for Success (Bot Trackable)**

* Include Factory vs MPF task completion rates/times.  
* Track MPF completion notification effectiveness (pickup task claim rate/time).

**9\. Risks and Challenges (Bot Context)**

* Accurate MPF EstimatedCompletionTime input by users is critical.  
* Managing parallel Factory/MPF queues for the same item type.  
* Complexity of decision logic for choosing Factory vs MPF.  
* Notification fatigue for MPF completions if volume is high.

**10\. Conclusion**

This enhanced design incorporates the vital differences between Factory and MPF production into the Discord bot's logistics coordination system. By managing distinct workflows, leveraging MPF efficiencies, utilizing Factories for speed, and providing timed notifications, the bot offers a more sophisticated and realistic tool for optimizing Foxhole logistics. Success requires accurate user input (especially MPF completion times), active participation, and careful configuration reflecting strategic priorities.

(Told it about the refinery queue)

Prompt:The bot should keep track of refinery queues. Depending on the item they can be lengthy. The bot should also keep track of resource gathering tasks because this can involve other coordination or inputs. Without adequate resources someone can't simply make an item, so there has to be refined materials already available.

Upon completion of refinery materials they can either be stored back in a storage depot until they are ready to be manufactured or they can be made directly from a factory.

It takes additional time to store, so making additional items is preferred. Additionally surpluses in stockpiles are okay, as they will likely be used later and having a bit too much is far preferable to running out of items.

## **Foxhole Logistics System Design: Pull-Based Model for Hex Superiority (Discord Bot Refinement)**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow. The bot manages tasks for **Resource Gathering, Refining, Midline/Backline production (at Factories and Mass Production Factories \- MPFs) and transportation**, feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots), as well as **Frontline (Last Mile) distribution** from those hubs to specific **Forward Bases** (Bunker Bases, FOBs). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs and Forward Bases trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot, potentially extending back to the initial resource gathering phase. This system functions analogously to a buffered reader, pulling data (supplies) through different stages via a task system.

**Important Note on Inventory Tracking:** The bot tracks inventory levels *at specific locations* (Resource Fields \- potentially, Refineries, Hubs, Bases) based on user reports (`!stock report`). During transport phases (represented by `CLAIMED` tasks), items are considered logically "In Progress" or "In Transit" but are **not** tracked as a separate inventory pool by the bot. Inventory counts are only updated when a `!stock report` reflects the new state *after* a delivery or *before* a pickup. This simplification is crucial given the complexity of tracking numerous mobile players.

**Note on Surpluses:** Target buffers defined in the bot represent *minimum desired levels*. Moderate surpluses resulting from efficient batching (e.g., MPF 5-crate minimums) or proactive gathering/refining are acceptable and often beneficial, providing resilience against demand spikes or disruptions. The system prioritizes avoiding shortages over strictly adhering to exact buffer numbers.

We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics States:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition through refining, production, storage, and delivery, accounting for different methods and locations.  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs generate prioritized tasks (Gathering, Refining, Production, Transport) within Discord, clarifying the logic for each pull level down to resource acquisition if necessary.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (using standardized loads and batching incentives), and ensure high availability of critical resources via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring sustained supply lines.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system, improving coordination, resource allocation, guiding players, and managing the distinct workflows from resource gathering to final delivery.

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant States & Task Phases)**

This outlines the lifecycle of supplies as tracked or managed by the bot. 'In Transit' and 'Queued' phases are represented by Bot Task statuses.

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs into actionable, prioritized tasks, potentially cascading down to resource gathering. FTL=15 crates, FCL=60 crates.

* **Level 1 Pull: Forward Base Demand (Last Mile)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low stock in `STORED_FORWARD_BASE` state vs buffer, or `!request`. Requires `--source [FrontlineHubName]`.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit, rounds up to FTL. Checks `STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` stock at source.  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `TRANSPORT_LAST_MILE` task if source stock sufficient.  
* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bulk Supply)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low stock in `STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` state vs buffer, `!request`, or Level 1 failure.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit, rounds up to FCL/FTL. Performs Critical Ping check. Triggers Level 3\.  
  * **Output Action:** Initiates Level 3 check/task generation.  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Production/Transport Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Deficit calculated at Level 2 for a Frontline Hub.  
  * **Logic:** Prioritizes need. Checks `STORED_BACKLINE` stock for finished goods.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If stock found: Generate `TRANSPORT` task.  
    * If no stock found: Trigger Level 0 Pull (Material Check).  
* **Level 0 Pull: Material Demand for Production**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level 3 determines production is needed (`QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task required).  
  * **Logic:** Checks availability of required refined materials (`REFINED_STORED` state) at or near the chosen production location (Factory/MPF). Requires `!stock report` data for relevant locations.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If materials sufficient: Generate `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task (Factory/MPF specific batches) and provide feasibility notice/estimate.  
    * If materials insufficient locally, check other `REFINED_STORED` locations: Generate `TRANSPORT_REFINED` task to move materials to the production site *before* the `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task can start (or mark production task as blocked).  
    * If materials insufficient globally: Trigger Level \-1 Pull (Refining Demand).  
* **Level \-1 Pull: Refining Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level 0 requires refined materials that are not available.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates required raw materials based on recipes. Checks availability of raw materials (`RAW_STORED` state) at or near Refineries. Requires `!stock report` data for raw materials.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If raw materials sufficient: Generate `QUEUE_REFINING` task at a Refinery. Assign priority based on the ultimate production need. User needs to update completion time.  
    * If raw materials insufficient locally, check other `RAW_STORED` locations: Generate `TRANSPORT_RAW` task to move raw materials to the Refinery *before* the `QUEUE_REFINING` task can start.  
    * If raw materials insufficient globally: Trigger Level \-2 Pull (Gathering Demand).  
* **Level \-2 Pull: Resource Gathering Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level \-1 requires raw materials that are not available.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies specific raw resource needed (Scrap, Components, Sulfur, etc.) and quantity.  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `GATHER_RESOURCE` task (e.g., `GATHER_RESOURCE Scrap [Qty] [TargetRefinery/Hub]`). Assigns priority. Players claim and manually complete this task.  
* **Level 4 Pull: Production Pickup Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Completion of `QUEUE_PRODUCTION`. Items in `PRODUCTION_READY` state.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies completed run. Determines destination (default: Backline Hub).  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` task. Notifies role on MPF completion.  
* **Level 5 Pull: Refining Pickup Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Completion of `QUEUE_REFINING` (timed). Items in `REFINING_READY` state.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies completed run. Determines destination (default: Backline Hub, potentially direct to Production if linked).  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `PICKUP_REFINED` task. Notifies role on completion (optional).

* **A. Command Interface:**  
  * **New/Updated Commands:**  
    * `!config set_refinery_complete_ping [Role]` \- (Admin) Optional ping for refinery completion.  
    * `!tasks create gather [ResourceType] [Quantity] [TargetHub/Refinery]` \- (User/Admin) Manually create gathering task.  
    * `!tasks create refine [MaterialType] [Quantity] [RefineryLocation]` \- (User/Admin) Manually create refining task. Requires subsequent `!tasks update ... set_completion_time`.  
    * `!tasks update [TaskID] set_completion_time [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` \- (User, claimer) **Now used for both MPF and Refinery** `QUEUE_...` tasks.  
    * `!stock report`: Scope potentially expands to include raw/refined materials at Hubs/Refineries. Requires clear location naming.  
    * `!tasks list/find`: Updated to show/filter new task types (`GATHER_RESOURCE`, `QUEUE_REFINING`, `PICKUP_REFINED`, `TRANSPORT_RAW`, `TRANSPORT_REFINED`) and related activities.  
  * *(Other commands as previously specified)*  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:** Handles priorities cascading down from high-level needs to potentially low-level gathering tasks.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Adds new TaskTypes.  
  * `QUEUE_REFINING` tasks need `EstimatedCompletionTime`.  
  * Background process handles timeouts and auto-completion for both MPF and Refinery queues.  
  * Dependency Management: `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` tasks might be blocked pending `TRANSPORT_REFINED` or Level \-1/-2 tasks. `QUEUE_REFINING` might be blocked pending `TRANSPORT_RAW` or Level \-2 tasks. Status should reflect blocks.  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * Implements full pull logic (Level 3 down to \-2).  
  * Includes prerequisite checks for materials before queuing production/refining.  
  * Acknowledges preference for direct use (e.g., Refinery \-\> Factory) but may default to simpler storage steps initially.  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:** Feasibility notices now reflect potential delays down to resource gathering.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * `Hubs`: Includes Refineries, potentially Resource Fields.  
  * `HubStockStatus`: Needs to track Raw and Refined materials in addition to produced goods. Requires robust item/material naming convention.  
  * `Tasks`: Adds new TaskTypes, potentially `BlockedByTaskID` field for dependencies. `EstimatedCompletionTime` used for Refining queues too.  
  * `Recipes`: Needs to include Raw \-\> Refined recipes.  
  * `GlobalConfig`: Add `RefineryCompletionPingRole`.  
* **G. Completion Rate Calculation:** Logic applies to new task types as well.

**6\. Information Flow & Communication (Bot Mediated)**

Bot manages the potentially deep dependency chain from final product request back to resource need, providing visibility and task management throughout.

**7\. Optimization Strategies (Bot Enabled)**

* Optimizing the Refinery \-\> Factory flow is a key area.  
* Proactive gathering/refining based on anticipated needs (driven by dashboard/status).

**8\. Metrics for Success (Bot Trackable)**

* Track completion rates/times for Gathering and Refining tasks.  
* Monitor frequency of tasks being blocked by material/resource shortages.  
* Measure end-to-end time from initial request to final delivery across all levels.

**9\. Risks and Challenges (Bot Context)**

* **Increased Data Dependency:** System effectiveness heavily relies on accurate and frequent `!stock report` data for raw/refined materials at multiple location types. This is a major challenge.  
* **Complexity:** Managing the multi-level dependencies and potential blocking states significantly increases bot complexity.  
* **User Input:** Requires users to reliably update completion times for Refining queues.  
* **Bottleneck Identification:** While highlighting shortages, resolving deep bottlenecks (e.g., lack of Sulfur) still requires significant player coordination outside the bot's direct control.

**10\. Conclusion**

This comprehensive design integrates resource gathering and refining into the pull-based logistics model. By creating tasks that cascade down to the most basic resource needs when necessary, the bot provides end-to-end visibility and coordination potential. However, this significantly increases the system's complexity and its reliance on accurate, widespread inventory reporting by users. The acceptance of surpluses and focus on avoiding shortages guides the overall logistics strategy facilitated by the bot.

* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system via Discord, improving coordination, resource allocation, guiding players, and managing the distinct workflows for Factory and MPF production.

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant States & Task Phases)**

This outlines the lifecycle of supplies as tracked or managed by the bot. Note that 'In Transit' phases are represented by the status of corresponding Bot Tasks, not distinct inventory states.

1. **`RAW`** (State: Resource Acquisition) \- Raw resources gathered. *Prerequisite, not directly tracked by bot.*  
2. **`REFINED`** (State: Material Refining) \- Raw resources converted to Bmats, Rmats, etc. *`Prerequisite, potentially tracked via !stock report at refineries/storage, but not actively managed by core pull logic.`*  
3. **`PRODUCTION_QUEUED`** (State: Manufacturing Queued) \- Production order submitted at Factory/MPF. Represented by an `OPEN` or `CLAIMED` `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` Task.  
4. **`PRODUCTION_READY`** (State: Manufacturing Pickup Ready) \- Crates finished and available for pickup at Factory/MPF. Triggered by completion of `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task. Generates a `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` Task.  
5. **`STORED_BACKLINE`** (State: Stored at Backline/Midline Hub) \- Items (refined materials, manufactured goods after pickup) stored in a Storage Depot/Seaport away from the frontline. Inventory tracked via `!stock report`. Source for Bulk Transport.  
6. **`IN_TRANSIT_PICKUP`** (Phase: Pickup Task Active) \- Represented by a `CLAIMED` `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` Task. Items are being moved from Factory/MPF to a Backline Hub.  
7. **`IN_TRANSIT_BULK`** (Phase: Bulk Transport Task Active) \- Represented by a `CLAIMED` `TRANSPORT` Task. Items are being moved from a Backline/Midline Hub to a Frontline Staging Hub.  
8. **`STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB`** (State: Stored at Frontline Staging Hub) \- Items delivered to the designated Frontline Storage Depot/Seaport. Inventory tracked via `!stock report`. Source for Last Mile Transport.  
9. **`IN_TRANSIT_LAST_MILE`** (Phase: Last Mile Transport Task Active) \- Represented by a `CLAIMED` `TRANSPORT_LAST_MILE` Task. Items are being moved from a Frontline Staging Hub to a Forward Base.  
10. **`STORED_FORWARD_BASE`** (State: Delivered to Forward Base) \- Items delivered to the requesting Bunker Base/FOB. Inventory tracked via `!stock report`. Final state managed by the bot.

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs into actionable, prioritized tasks. FTL (Full Truck Load) \= **15 crates**. FCL (Full Container Load) \= **60 crates**.

* **Level 1 Pull: Forward Base Demand (Last Mile)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low reported stock (`STORED_FORWARD_BASE` state) compared to target buffer OR explicit `!request` for a Forward Base (e.g., `SafeHouse`). Requires `--source [FrontlineHubName]`.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit at the Forward Base. Rounds need up to nearest FTL (15 crates). Checks if sufficient stock exists in the reported inventory of the specified source (`STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` state).  
  * **Output Action:** If source stock is sufficient (or assumed sufficient if no recent report), generates a `TRANSPORT_LAST_MILE` task from `[FrontlineHubName]` to `[ForwardBaseName]`. Assigns priority based on Forward Base need.  
* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bulk Supply)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low reported stock (`STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` state) compared to target buffer OR explicit `!request` for a Frontline Hub (e.g., `PortTine`). Also triggered if a Level 1 pull fails due to lack of stock at the Frontline Hub.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit at the Frontline Hub. Rounds need up to nearest FCL (60) or FTL (15) based on item type/config. Performs Critical Ping check if stock drops below threshold. Triggers Level 3 actions to fulfill the deficit.  
  * **Output Action:** Initiates Level 3 check/task generation.  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Task Generation (Production/Transport)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Deficit calculated at Level 2 for a Frontline Hub.  
  * **Logic:**  
    1. Assigns priority based on Frontline Hub need (Item Type, Deficit Severity, Urgency).  
    2. Checks reported stock at known Backline Hubs (`STORED_BACKLINE` state) for the required quantity (FCL/FTL).  
    3. If sufficient stock found: Generates `TRANSPORT` task from `[BacklineHub]` to `[FrontlineHub]`.  
    4. If no stock found: Determines production location (Factory/MPF) based on item type, urgency, quantity, preference flags. Generates `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task (Factory: up to 4 crates; MPF: batches of 5 crates). Provides feasibility notice based on queue depth/priority.  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `TRANSPORT` or `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task and adds it to the queue.  
* **Level 4 Pull: Production Pickup Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Completion of a `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task (manual for Factory, timed for MPF). Items are now in `PRODUCTION_READY` state at the Factory/MPF.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies the completed production run (quantity, item, location). Determines the standard destination (usually a nearby Backline Hub for storage).  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` task from `[Factory/MPF_Location]` to `[Default_BacklineHub]`. Assigns priority. Notifies relevant role upon MPF completion. Adds task to the queue.  
* **(Potential Level 0 Pull: Material Demand \- Future Enhancement)**  
  * *`Could be triggered if a QUEUE_PRODUCTION task cannot be started due to lack of refined materials (REFINED state) at the production site. Would generate tasks to transport materials or potentially trigger refining tasks. Not included in the current core logic.`*

**10\. Conclusion**

This refined design clarifies the logistical states and pull-level logic managed by the Discord bot. By explicitly defining the inventory states (Stored Locations) and representing transport phases via task statuses ("In Progress"), the system provides a robust yet manageable framework for coordinating complex Foxhole logistics from backline production to frontline delivery, while setting realistic expectations through completion estimates.

## **Told it about the MPF**

## **Foxhole Logistics System Design: Pull-Based Model for Hex Superiority (Discord Bot Refinement)**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow. The bot manages tasks for **Midline/Backline production (at Factories and Mass Production Factories \- MPFs) and transportation** feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots), as well as **Frontline (Last Mile) distribution** from those hubs to specific **Forward Bases** (Bunker Bases, FOBs). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs and Forward Bases trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot. This system functions analogously to a buffered reader, pulling data (supplies) through different stages via a task system. We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics Steps:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition to delivery at Forward Bases, accounting for different production methods (Factory/MPF).  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs generate prioritized production (Factory/MPF specific) and transport tasks within Discord.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (using standardized FTL/FCL values and considering Factory/MPF batching incentives), and ensure high availability of critical resources via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring Frontline Staging Hubs and Forward Bases are consistently supplied.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system via Discord, improving coordination, resource allocation, guiding players, and managing the distinct workflows for Factory and MPF production.

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant Stages for Bot)**

1. **Resource Acquisition (State: RAW)** \- *Prerequisite.*  
2. **Material Refining (State: PROCESSED)** \- *Prerequisite.*  
3. **Manufacturing Queued (State: QUEUED\_PROD)** \- Submitting a production order at a **Factory** or **MPF**. Managed by Bot Task (location specified).  
4. **Manufacturing Pickup (State: PRODUCT\_READY)** \- Retrieving finished crates from **Factory** or **MPF**. Managed by Bot Task.  
5. **Storage & Staging (State: BUFFERED/CACHED)** \- Hubs act as sources/destinations.  
6. **Bulk Transportation (State: INTER-HEX TRANSIT)** \- Managed by Bot Tasks (FTL/FCL quantities). Context: Single shippables/containers, Ironships (5), Trains (\~13).  
7. **Delivery to Frontline Hub (State: STAGED)** \- Endpoint for bulk transport, source for last-mile.  
8. **Last-Mile Transportation (State: INTRA-HEX TRANSIT)** \- Managed by Bot Tasks (FTL quantities).  
9. **Delivery to Forward Base (State: DELIVERED\_FRONT)** \- Endpoint for bot-managed tasks. *(Consumption is outside this bot's scope)*

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs into actionable, prioritized tasks, differentiating between Factory and MPF production. FTL (Full Truck Load) \= **15 crates**. FCL (Full Container Load) \= **60 crates**.

* **Level 1 Pull: Forward Base Demand (Last Mile)**  
  * *`(Trigger/Bot Action largely unchanged, generates TRANSPORT_LAST_MILE tasks)`*  
* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bulk Supply)**  
  * *(Trigger/Bot Action largely unchanged, calculates deficit, triggers Level 3, performs Critical Ping Check)*  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Task Generation (Production/Transport)**  
  * **Trigger:** Quantified need (deficit) calculated at Level 2\.  
  * **Bot Action (Task Creation & Prioritization):**  
    1. **Prioritization:** Assign priority score (Item Type, Deficit Severity, Urgency Flag).  
    2. **Check Backline Stock:** Attempt to find needed crates in reported backline hub stocks.  
    3. **`Generate TRANSPORT Task:`** If sufficient stock found, create `TRANSPORT` task.  
    4. **Determine Production Location (If No Stock):**  
       * **Factory Mandatory:** If Item is Engineering or Medical category.  
       * **MPF Mandatory:** If Item is Vehicle or Structure category.  
       * **Player Choice/Default (Other Items):**  
         * If `Urgency=High` or deficit is small (\< 3-5 crates), lean towards **Factory**.  
         * Otherwise (standard urgency, larger deficits), default to **MPF** to leverage discounts and long-term planning.  
    5. **`Generate QUEUE_PRODUCTION Task:`**  
       * **If Factory:** Create `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task for Factory. Batch size up to 4 crates per task (reflecting queue limits). Task quantity based on deficit up to 4\. Multiple tasks may be generated if deficit \> 4\.  
       * **If MPF:** Create `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task for MPF. **Batch size is always 5 crates** (or multiples of 5 if deficit is very large) to maximize discount. Task quantity is fixed at 5 (or multiple). *Note: May slightly overproduce small deficits, but optimizes cost.* Specify target location as MPF.  
    6. **Feasibility Notice:** Provide warning if request priority is low relative to queue depth.  
    7. **Add to Queue:** Add generated task(s). Handle duplicates.  
* **Level 4: Production Completion & Pickup**  
  * **Trigger (Factory):** User marks `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` (Factory) task complete via `!tasks complete [TaskID]`.  
  * **Trigger (MPF):** `CurrentTime >= EstimatedCompletionTime` for a claimed `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` (MPF) task.  
  * **Bot Action:**  
    1. Mark the `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task as `COMPLETE`.  
    2. Generate `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` task: `PICKUP_PRODUCTION [Qty]x[Item] from [Factory/MPF_Location]`. Destination is typically a nearby Backline Hub. Assign priority. Link to the original queue task ID.  
    3. **MPF Completion Notification:** If the completed task was MPF, ping the configured role (`!config set_mpf_complete_ping`).  
    4. Add `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` task to the queue.

**5\. Discord Bot Implementation Details**

* **A. Command Interface:** (Expanded & Refined Details)  
  * `!config set_task_timeout [DurationHours]` \- (Admin) Sets global task claim timeout.

  * `!hub config [HubName] set_buffer [Item] [TargetQty]` \- (Admin) Sets target stock level.  
  * `!hub config [HubName] set_item_priority [Item] [PriorityScore] [DefaultProd=MPF/Factory] [TransportLoad=FTL/FCL]` \- (Admin) Sets item priority, default production location choice (for eligible items), and typical bulk transport load type.  
  * `!hub config [HubName] set_critical_ping [Item] [ThresholdPercent] [Role/User]` \- (Admin) Configures critical stock alerts.  
  * `!stock report [HubNameOrBaseName] [--source FrontlineHubName] [Item1]=[Qty1] ...` \- (User) Reports stock levels.  
  * `!request [HubNameOrBaseName] [--source FrontlineHubName] [Item1]=[Qty1] ... [Urgency=Low/Med/High] [--prefer Factory/MPF]` \- (User) Requests items. Optional `--prefer` flag influences production location choice for eligible items.  
  * `!tasks list [HubName (Optional)] [--type TaskType] [--loc Factory/MPF]` \- (User) Shows open tasks, with optional filtering by type or production location. *Output now indicates Factory/MPF for production tasks and estimated completion for MPF queues.*  
  * `!tasks find [Activity] [HubName (Optional)]` \- (User) Helps find tasks. Activities updated slightly: `transport_ftl`, `transport_fcl`, `transport_vehicle` (groups tasks for containers/shippables), `production_factory_[Item]`, `production_mpf_[Item]`, `pickup_factory`, `pickup_mpf`. `transport_ironship`/`transport_train` could show groups of FCL tasks to nearby hubs as a potential enhancement.  
  * `!tasks claim [TaskID]` \- (User) Claims task. Sets timeout.  
  * `!tasks update [TaskID] set_completion_time [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` \- (User, must be claimer) **Crucial for MPF:** Allows user who claimed `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` (MPF) task to input the actual estimated completion time from the in-game UI. This updates the `EstimatedCompletionTime` for the task.  
  * `!tasks complete [TaskID]` \- (User, must be claimer) Marks task done. **Primarily used for non-MPF-queue tasks** (Transport, Pickup, Factory Queues). Triggers `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` generation for completed Factory queues.  
  * `!tasks abandon [TaskID]` \- (User, must be claimer) Releases task.  
  * `!production calc [Item] [Qty] [--loc Factory/MPF]` \- (User) Calculates material cost, noting MPF discounts are applied implicitly for MPF calculations (maybe show base vs discounted cost).  
  * `!status [HubNameOrBaseName]` \- (User) Shows health status (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢) and task summary.  
  * `!dashboard` \- (User) High-level overview: Top priority tasks, network flow summary (tasks completed, crates moved/produced), critical hub alerts.  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:** Handles Factory/MPF distinction.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Adds `ProductionLocationType` (Factory/MPF) and `EstimatedCompletionTime` fields to `Tasks`.  
  * Background process checks for task timeouts AND MPF completion times (`CurrentTime >= EstimatedCompletionTime`).  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * **Factory/MPF Decision:** Implements logic described in Section 4\. Considers item type, urgency, quantity, `--prefer` flag, and configured defaults.  
  * **Batching:** Factory tasks up to 4 crates. MPF tasks always 5 crates (or multiples) for items produced there.  
  * **MPF Timing:** Relies on user input via `!tasks update ... set_completion_time` for accuracy. Auto-completes queue task and generates pickup task based on this time. Notifies designated role.  
  * **Transport Context:** Bot generates tasks for FTL (15) / FCL (60) crates. Players use `!tasks find` to identify tasks suitable for specific transport methods (trucks, flatbeds, containers, potentially grouping for freighters/trains).  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:** Feasibility notices remain. MPF's high cost/time encourages planning.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * `Hubs`: (HubName, LocationType ...)  
  * `HubStockStatus`: (HubName, Item, TargetBufferQty, CurrentQty, ReportTimestamp, ReportedByUserID, CriticalThresholdPercent, PingRoleOrUser)  
  * `ItemPriorities`: (Item, PriorityScore, DefaultProdLocation `// Factory/MPF`, DefaultTransportLoad `// FTL/FCL`)

  * `Recipes`: (OutputItem, OutputQty, InputItem, InputQty, **ProductionLocation** `// Factory/MPF/Both`)  
  * `GlobalConfig`: (SettingName, Value `// e.g., TaskTimeoutHours, MPFCompletionPingRole`)

**6\. Information Flow & Communication (Bot Mediated)**

Bot orchestrates flow, differentiating Factory/MPF paths, providing timed alerts for MPF completions.

**7\. Optimization Strategies (Bot Enabled)**

* Leverages MPF discounts via batching.  
* Directs urgent needs to faster Factories.  
* Provides visibility into distinct production pipelines.

**8\. Metrics for Success (Bot Trackable)**

* Include Factory vs MPF task completion rates/times.  
* Track MPF completion notification effectiveness (pickup task claim rate/time).

**9\. Risks and Challenges (Bot Context)**

* Accurate MPF `EstimatedCompletionTime` input by users is critical.  
* Managing parallel Factory/MPF queues for the same item type.  
* Complexity of decision logic for choosing Factory vs MPF.  
* Notification fatigue for MPF completions if volume is high.

**10\. Conclusion**

This enhanced design incorporates the vital differences between Factory and MPF production into the Discord bot's logistics coordination system. By managing distinct workflows, leveraging MPF efficiencies, utilizing Factories for speed, and providing timed notifications, the bot offers a more sophisticated and realistic tool for optimizing Foxhole logistics. Success requires accurate user input (especially MPF completion times), active participation, and careful configuration reflecting strategic priorities.

Before MPFs:

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow, but the focus shifts to managing **Midline/Backline production and transportation** feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot. We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics. Last-mile distribution (Hub to Bunker Base) is considered outside the scope of this specific bot implementation.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics Steps:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition to delivery at a Frontline Staging Hub.  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs at Frontline Hubs generate prioritized production and transport tasks within Discord.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (assuming Full Truck/Container Loads \- FTL/FCL), and ensure high availability of critical resources at staging hubs via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring Frontline Staging Hubs are consistently supplied.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system via Discord for logi players, improving coordination, resource allocation for Midline/Backline operations, and **guiding players seeking ways to contribute.**

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant Stages for Bot)**

*(Stages 1-4 remain largely the same conceptually but feed into the bot's managed tasks)*

1. **Resource Acquisition (State: RAW)** \- *Prerequisite, potentially tracked indirectly.*  
2. **Material Refining (State: PROCESSED)** \- *Prerequisite, potentially tracked indirectly.*  
3. **Manufacturing (State: PRODUCT)** \- *Generates items that can fulfill bot tasks.*  
4. **Storage & Staging (State: BUFFERED/CACHED)** \- *Backline/Midline hubs act as sources for Transport tasks. Frontline hubs are the targets.*  
5. **Bulk Transportation (State: INTER-HEX TRANSIT)** \- ***Directly managed by Bot Tasks.*** Moving FTL/FCL quantities between Backline/Midline hubs and the target Frontline Staging Hub.  
6. **Delivery to Frontline Hub (State: STAGED)** \- The endpoint for bot-managed tasks. Supplies arrive at the designated Frontline Seaport/Depot.

*(Last-Mile Distribution and Consumption are outside this bot's scope)*

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs at the Frontline Staging Hub into actionable, prioritized tasks managed via Discord commands.

* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bot Input Event)**  
  * **Trigger:**  
    1. **Stock Report:** A user reports current stock levels at a specific Frontline Staging Hub using a Discord command (e.g., `!stock report [HubName] shirts=50 bmats=2000 ...`).  
    2. **Explicit Request:** A user explicitly requests items for a hub (e.g., `!request [HubName] shirts=200 bmats=5000`). This acts as a demand signal supplementing stock reports.  
  * **Bot Action (Event Processing):**  
    1. **Parse Input:** Understand the hub, items, and quantities reported/requested.  
    2. **Compare to Buffers:** Retrieve predefined target buffer levels for the specified `[HubName]` (set by admins via `!hub config`).  
    3. **Calculate Deficit:** Determine the difference `(Target Buffer - Current Stock)` for each item, using the most recent stock report for that item/hub. Negative deficits (surpluses) are ignored for task generation.  
    4. **Quantify Need:** Convert the deficit into standard logistical units (crates).  
    5. **Apply FTL/FCL:** Round up the required crates to the nearest full transport load (e.g., Container, Flatbed of materials, Freighter capacity) based on predefined vehicle capacities. This determines the actual quantity for task generation. *Example: Deficit \= 120 crates Bmats. Container capacity \= 100 crates. Need \= 2 Containers (200 crates).*  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Task Generation (Bot Output Event)**  
  * **Trigger:** A quantified need (deficit rounded to FTL/FCL) calculated at Level 2\.  
  * **Bot Action (Task Creation & Prioritization):**  
    1. **Prioritization:** Assign a priority score based on:  
       * **Item Type:** Critical items (Shirts, Bmats, GSups) receive the highest base priority. Other common items (basic ammo, meds) medium, specialized items lower. (Configurable weights).  
       * **Deficit Severity:** Increase priority if current stock is critically low (e.g., \<10% of buffer).  
       * **Urgency Flag:** Allow users to add `Urgency=High` to `!request` for a priority boost (potentially requires admin approval or has limits).  
    2. **Task Determination:**  
       * **Check Backline Stock (Optional):** *If* the bot has data on backline public stockpiles (via `!stock report [BacklineHub]`), it can first check if the needed FTL/FCL quantity is available there.  
       * **`Generate TRANSPORT Task:`** If available in the backline, create a task: `TRANSPORT [Qty]x[Item] from [SourceHub] to [DestinationHub]`.  
       * **`Generate PRODUCE Task:`** If not readily available or if it's a manufactured item, create a task: `PRODUCE [Qty]x[Item]`. This task implies the need for prerequisite materials. *`Optionally, the bot could generate linked TRANSPORT Materials tasks if needed materials aren't co-located.`*  
    3. **Add to Queue:** Place the generated task(s) into a prioritized list associated with the target `[HubName]`. Ensure duplicate tasks for the exact same need are handled (e.g., don't create a new task if an identical OPEN one exists).

**5\. Discord Bot Implementation Details**

* **A. Command Interface:**  
  * `!hub config [HubName] set_buffer [Item] [TargetQty]` \- (Admin) Sets target stock level for an item at a hub.  
  * `!hub config [HubName] set_item_priority [Item] [PriorityScore]` \- (Admin) Sets base priority for item types.  
  * `!hub config [HubName] set_transport_capacity [Vehicle] [ItemType/Crate] [Capacity]` \- (Admin) Defines FTL/FCL sizes.  
  * `!stock report [HubName] [Item1]=[Qty1] [Item2]=[Qty2] ...` \- (User) Reports current stock at any hub (Frontline or Backline). Updates the `CurrentQty` and `ReportTimestamp` for the specified items/hub.  
  * `!request [HubName] [Item1]=[Qty1] [Item2]=[Qty2] ... [Urgency=Low/Med/High]` \- (User) Explicitly requests items for a Frontline Hub. Triggers deficit calculation.  
  * `!tasks list [HubName]` \- (User) Shows open, prioritized tasks for a Frontline Hub. Displays TaskID, Priority, Type, Item, Qty, Source/Destination, Status (OPEN/CLAIMED by User).  
  * `!tasks find [Activity] [HubName (Optional)]` \- (User) Helps players find relevant tasks. Examples:  
    * `!tasks find transport_train` \- Shows open `TRANSPORT` tasks suitable for trains (large volume, potentially rail-linked hubs).  
    * `!tasks find transport_flatbed` \- Shows `TRANSPORT` tasks for containers/vehicles.  
    * `!tasks find production_shirts [HubName]` \- Shows open `PRODUCE` tasks for shirts, optionally filtered by target hub.  
    * `!tasks find scrap` \- *Bot provides guidance*: "Scrap is always needed for Bmats/Rmats\! Check `!status [BacklineHub]` to see material needs and deliver refined materials there, or look for `PRODUCE` tasks blocked by missing materials." (Does not list direct scrap tasks as they aren't generated by this model).  
  * `!tasks claim [TaskID]` \- (User) Claims an OPEN task. Status changes to `CLAIMED by [User]`.  
  * `!tasks complete [TaskID]` \- (User, must be claimer) Marks task as done. Task removed from active list (or moved to history). *`Bot assumes completion contributes to stock, but relies on future !stock report for confirmation.`*  
  * `!tasks abandon [TaskID]` \- (User, must be claimer) Releases task back to OPEN status.  
  * `!production calc [Item] [Qty]` \- (User) Basic helper: Shows materials needed for `Qty` crates of `Item`.  
  * `!status [HubName]` \- (User) Shows current reported stock vs. target buffers and a summary of open tasks for a Frontline Hub.  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:**  
  * Tasks stored with a calculated priority score.  
  * `!tasks list` displays tasks sorted highest priority first.  
  * Priority \= `BaseItemPriority + UrgencyBonus + DeficitSeverityBonus`. Weights are configurable.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Database/storage tracks tasks with unique IDs.  
  * Fields: `TaskID`, `TargetHub`, `TaskType` (PRODUCE/TRANSPORT), `Item`, `Quantity` (FTL/FCL adjusted), `PriorityScore`, `Status` (OPEN, CLAIMED, COMPLETE, ABANDONED), `ClaimedByUserID`, `SourceHub` (for Transport), `CreatedAt`, `CompletedAt`.  
  * Bot prevents claiming already claimed tasks. Only claimer can complete/abandon.  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * **FTL/FCL Enforcement:** All generated tasks represent full loads. Deficits are always rounded *up* to the next full load. Capacities defined via `!hub config`.  
  * **Production Calculation:** Uses stored recipes (`Item`, `OutputQty`, `InputItem`, `InputQty`) for `!production calc` and potentially for generating material transport tasks.  
  * **Buffer Driven:** The core loop is `Report Stock -> Calculate Deficit vs Buffer -> Generate Tasks to Fill Deficit`. The system aims to keep hubs at their target buffer levels.  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:**  
  * **Transparency:** `!status`, `!tasks list`, and `!tasks find` show ongoing efforts, reducing duplicate requests and guiding contributors.  
  * **Cost Awareness:** `!request` could optionally reply with the estimated material cost.  
  * **FTL/FCL Nature:** Requesting small amounts is inefficient as tasks are generated for full loads anyway, naturally discouraging tiny requests.  
  * **Admin Oversight:** Logi leads can monitor requests and task lists for abuse or inefficiency.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * `Hubs`: (HubName, LocationType) `// Defines known logistics hubs`  
  * `HubStockStatus`: (HubName, Item, TargetBufferQty, CurrentQty, ReportTimestamp, ReportedByUserID) `// Combines buffer targets and latest reported stock`  
  * `ItemPriorities`: (Item, PriorityScore) `// Base priority for task generation`  
  * `TransportCapacities`: (Vehicle, ItemType, Capacity) `// For FTL/FCL calculations`  
  * `Tasks`: (TaskID, TargetHub, TaskType, Item, Quantity, PriorityScore, Status, ClaimedByUserID, SourceHub, CreatedAt, CompletedAt, ...) `// Tracks active and historical tasks`  
  * `Recipes`: (OutputItem, OutputQty, InputItem, InputQty) `// For !production calc`

**6\. Information Flow & Communication (Bot Mediated)**

The Discord bot becomes the central message bus and task coordinator for Midline/Backline logistics supporting specific Frontline Hubs. Standardized commands replace free-form chat for requests and status updates related to these hubs, and provide guidance for players looking for tasks.

**7\. Optimization Strategies (Bot Enabled)**

* **Prioritized Execution:** Ensures critical supplies are worked on first.  
* **FTL/FCL Efficiency:** Maximizes transport capacity usage.  
* **Reduced Coordination Overhead:** Centralized task list reduces confusion about who is doing what.  
* **Targeted Contribution:** `!tasks find` helps players efficiently apply their efforts where needed and desired.  
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Needs are based on reported stock levels vs. defined targets.

**8\. Metrics for Success (Bot Trackable)**

* **Hub Buffer Health (%):** Average % of target buffer met across monitored items/hubs.  
* **Task Completion Rate (%):** % of generated tasks marked complete.  
* **Task Cycle Time (hours):** Average time from task creation to completion.  
* **Queue Length:** Number of open tasks per hub (indicates backlog).  
* **Task Claim Rate (%):** % of open tasks currently claimed (indicates engagement).

**9\. Risks and Challenges (Bot Context)**

* **Data Staleness:** Relies on timely and accurate `!stock report` commands from users. Inaccurate reports lead to bad task generation.  
* **Scope Creep:** Resisting the urge to add too many features (e.g., complex resource dependency tracking, automated scraping) which increase complexity.  
* **User Adoption:** Players need to consistently use the bot commands for it to be effective.  
* **Gaming the System:** Users potentially manipulating reports or requests (requires monitoring).  
* **Bot Downtime:** The coordination system fails if the bot is offline.

**10\. Conclusion**

Implementing this refined pull-based model via a Discord bot provides a structured, semi-automated system for managing Midline/Backline logistics in Foxhole. By translating reported needs at Frontline Staging Hubs into prioritized, FTL/FCL-based tasks, and by providing tools for players to find relevant work, the bot facilitates better coordination, improves resource allocation, guides player contribution, and supports the strategic goal of maintaining well-supplied forward bases. Success depends heavily on accurate user reporting, disciplined use of the task management features, and clear configuration of buffers and priorities.

## 1\. Introduction

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow, but the focus shifts to managing **Midline/Backline production and transportation** feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot. We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics. Last-mile distribution (Hub to Bunker Base) is considered outside the scope of this specific bot implementation.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics Steps:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition to delivery at a Frontline Staging Hub.  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs at Frontline Hubs generate prioritized production and transport tasks within Discord.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (assuming Full Truck/Container Loads \- FTL/FCL), and ensure high availability of critical resources at staging hubs via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring Frontline Staging Hubs are consistently supplied.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system via Discord for logi players, improving coordination, resource allocation for Midline/Backline operations, and **guiding players seeking ways to contribute.**

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant Stages for Bot)**

*(Stages 1-4 remain largely the same conceptually but feed into the bot's managed tasks)*

1. **Resource Acquisition (State: RAW)** \- *Prerequisite, potentially tracked indirectly.*  
2. **Material Refining (State: PROCESSED)** \- *Prerequisite, potentially tracked indirectly.*  
3. **Manufacturing (State: PRODUCT)** \- *Generates items that can fulfill bot tasks.*  
4. **Storage & Staging (State: BUFFERED/CACHED)** \- *Backline/Midline hubs act as sources for Transport tasks. Frontline hubs are the targets.*  
5. **Bulk Transportation (State: INTER-HEX TRANSIT)** \- ***Directly managed by Bot Tasks.*** Moving FTL/FCL quantities between Backline/Midline hubs and the target Frontline Staging Hub.  
6. **Delivery to Frontline Hub (State: STAGED)** \- The endpoint for bot-managed tasks. Supplies arrive at the designated Frontline Seaport/Depot.

*(Last-Mile Distribution and Consumption are outside this bot's scope)*

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs at the Frontline Staging Hub into actionable, prioritized tasks managed via Discord commands.

* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bot Input Event)**  
  * **Trigger:**  
    1. **Stock Report:** A user reports current stock levels at a specific Frontline Staging Hub using a Discord command (e.g., \!stock report \[HubName\] shirts=50 bmats=2000 ...).  
    2. **Explicit Request:** A user explicitly requests items for a hub (e.g., \!request \[HubName\] shirts=200 bmats=5000). This acts as a demand signal supplementing stock reports.  
  * **Bot Action (Event Processing):**  
    1. **Parse Input:** Understand the hub, items, and quantities reported/requested.  
    2. **Compare to Buffers:** Retrieve predefined target buffer levels for the specified \[HubName\] (set by admins via \!hub config).  
    3. **Calculate Deficit:** Determine the difference (Target Buffer \- Current Stock) for each item, using the most recent stock report for that item/hub. Negative deficits (surpluses) are ignored for task generation.  
    4. **Quantify Need:** Convert the deficit into standard logistical units (crates).  
    5. **Apply FTL/FCL:** Round up the required crates to the nearest full transport load (e.g., Container, Flatbed of materials, Freighter capacity) based on predefined vehicle capacities. This determines the actual quantity for task generation. *Example: Deficit \= 120 crates Bmats. Container capacity \= 100 crates. Need \= 2 Containers (200 crates).*  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Task Generation (Bot Output Event)**  
  * **Trigger:** A quantified need (deficit rounded to FTL/FCL) calculated at Level 2\.  
  * **Bot Action (Task Creation & Prioritization):**  
    1. **Prioritization:** Assign a priority score based on:  
       * **Item Type:** Critical items (Shirts, Bmats, GSups) receive the highest base priority. Other common items (basic ammo, meds) medium, specialized items lower. (Configurable weights).  
       * **Deficit Severity:** Increase priority if current stock is critically low (e.g., \<10% of buffer).  
       * **Urgency Flag:** Allow users to add Urgency=High to \!request for a priority boost (potentially requires admin approval or has limits).  
    2. **Task Determination:**  
       * **Check Backline Stock (Optional):** *If* the bot has data on backline public stockpiles (via \!stock report \[BacklineHub\]), it can first check if the needed FTL/FCL quantity is available there.  
       * **Generate TRANSPORT Task:** If available in the backline, create a task: TRANSPORT \[Qty\]x\[Item\] from \[SourceHub\] to \[DestinationHub\].  
       * **Generate PRODUCE Task:** If not readily available or if it's a manufactured item, create a task: PRODUCE \[Qty\]x\[Item\]. This task implies the need for prerequisite materials. *Optionally, the bot could generate linked TRANSPORT Materials tasks if needed materials aren't co-located.*  
    3. **Add to Queue:** Place the generated task(s) into a prioritized list associated with the target \[HubName\]. Ensure duplicate tasks for the exact same need are handled (e.g., don't create a new task if an identical OPEN one exists).

**5\. Discord Bot Implementation Details**

* **A. Command Interface:**  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_buffer \[Item\] \[TargetQty\] \- (Admin) Sets target stock level for an item at a hub.  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_item\_priority \[Item\] \[PriorityScore\] \- (Admin) Sets base priority for item types.  
  * \!hub config \[HubName\] set\_transport\_capacity \[Vehicle\] \[ItemType/Crate\] \[Capacity\] \- (Admin) Defines FTL/FCL sizes.  
  * \!stock report \[HubName\] \[Item1\]=\[Qty1\] \[Item2\]=\[Qty2\] ... \- (User) Reports current stock at any hub (Frontline or Backline). Updates the CurrentQty and ReportTimestamp for the specified items/hub.  
  * \!request \[HubName\] \[Item1\]=\[Qty1\] \[Item2\]=\[Qty2\] ... \[Urgency=Low/Med/High\] \- (User) Explicitly requests items for a Frontline Hub. Triggers deficit calculation.  
  * \!tasks list \[HubName\] \- (User) Shows open, prioritized tasks for a Frontline Hub. Displays TaskID, Priority, Type, Item, Qty, Source/Destination, Status (OPEN/CLAIMED by User).  
  * \!tasks find \[Activity\] \[HubName (Optional)\] \- (User) Helps players find relevant tasks. Examples:  
    * \!tasks find transport\_train \- Shows open TRANSPORT tasks suitable for trains (large volume, potentially rail-linked hubs).  
    * \!tasks find transport\_flatbed \- Shows TRANSPORT tasks for containers/vehicles.  
    * \!tasks find production\_shirts \[HubName\] \- Shows open PRODUCE tasks for shirts, optionally filtered by target hub.  
    * \!tasks find scrap \- *Bot provides guidance*: "Scrap is always needed for Bmats/Rmats\! Check \!status \[BacklineHub\] to see material needs and deliver refined materials there, or look for PRODUCE tasks blocked by missing materials." (Does not list direct scrap tasks as they aren't generated by this model).  
  * \!tasks claim \[TaskID\] \- (User) Claims an OPEN task. Status changes to CLAIMED by \[User\].  
  * \!tasks complete \[TaskID\] \- (User, must be claimer) Marks task as done. Task removed from active list (or moved to history). *Bot assumes completion contributes to stock, but relies on future \!stock report for confirmation.*  
  * \!tasks abandon \[TaskID\] \- (User, must be claimer) Releases task back to OPEN status.  
  * \!production calc \[Item\] \[Qty\] \- (User) Basic helper: Shows materials needed for Qty crates of Item.  
  * \!status \[HubName\] \- (User) Shows current reported stock vs. target buffers and a summary of open tasks for a Frontline Hub.  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:**  
  * Tasks stored with a calculated priority score.  
  * \!tasks list displays tasks sorted highest priority first.  
  * Priority \= BaseItemPriority \+ UrgencyBonus \+ DeficitSeverityBonus. Weights are configurable.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Database/storage tracks tasks with unique IDs.  
  * Fields: TaskID, TargetHub, TaskType (PRODUCE/TRANSPORT), Item, Quantity (FTL/FCL adjusted), PriorityScore, Status (OPEN, CLAIMED, COMPLETE, ABANDONED), ClaimedByUserID, SourceHub (for Transport), CreatedAt, CompletedAt.  
  * Bot prevents claiming already claimed tasks. Only claimer can complete/abandon.  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * **FTL/FCL Enforcement:** All generated tasks represent full loads. Deficits are always rounded *up* to the next full load. Capacities defined via \!hub config.  
  * **Production Calculation:** Uses stored recipes (Item, OutputQty, InputItem, InputQty) for \!production calc and potentially for generating material transport tasks.  
  * **Buffer Driven:** The core loop is Report Stock \-\> Calculate Deficit vs Buffer \-\> Generate Tasks to Fill Deficit. The system aims to keep hubs at their target buffer levels.  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:**  
  * **Transparency:** \!status, \!tasks list, and \!tasks find show ongoing efforts, reducing duplicate requests and guiding contributors.  
  * **Cost Awareness:** \!request could optionally reply with the estimated material cost.  
  * **FTL/FCL Nature:** Requesting small amounts is inefficient as tasks are generated for full loads anyway, naturally discouraging tiny requests.  
  * **Admin Oversight:** Logi leads can monitor requests and task lists for abuse or inefficiency.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * Hubs: (HubName, LocationType) // Defines known logistics hubs  
  * HubStockStatus: (HubName, Item, TargetBufferQty, CurrentQty, ReportTimestamp, ReportedByUserID) // Combines buffer targets and latest reported stock  
  * ItemPriorities: (Item, PriorityScore) // Base priority for task generation  
  * TransportCapacities: (Vehicle, ItemType, Capacity) // For FTL/FCL calculations  
  * Tasks: (TaskID, TargetHub, TaskType, Item, Quantity, PriorityScore, Status, ClaimedByUserID, SourceHub, CreatedAt, CompletedAt, ...) // Tracks active and historical tasks  
  * Recipes: (OutputItem, OutputQty, InputItem, InputQty) // For \!production calc

## **Foxhole Logistics System Design: Pull-Based Model for Hex Superiority (Discord Bot Refinement)**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines a design for an optimized logistics workflow in the game Foxhole, specifically tailored for implementation via a **Discord Bot**. The primary goal remains to establish and maintain logistical superiority by ensuring efficient supply flow. The bot manages tasks for **Resource Gathering, Refining, Midline/Backline production (at Factories and Mass Production Factories \- MPFs) and transportation**, feeding into designated **Frontline Staging Hubs** (Seaports/Storage Depots), as well as **Frontline (Last Mile) distribution** from those hubs to specific **Forward Bases** (Bunker Bases, FOBs). This design utilizes a **pull-based model**, where demand signals originating from the needs of these Frontline Hubs and Forward Bases trigger prioritized tasks managed by the bot, potentially extending back to the initial resource gathering phase. This system functions analogously to a buffered reader, pulling data (supplies) through different stages via a task system.

**Important Note on Inventory Tracking:** The bot tracks inventory levels *at specific locations* (Resource Fields \- potentially, Refineries, Hubs, Bases) based on user reports (`!stock report`). During transport phases (represented by `CLAIMED` tasks), items are considered logically "In Progress" or "In Transit" but are **not** tracked as a separate inventory pool by the bot. Inventory counts are only updated when a `!stock report` reflects the new state *after* a delivery or *before* a pickup. This simplification is crucial given the complexity of tracking numerous mobile players.

**Note on Surpluses:** Target buffers defined in the bot represent *minimum desired levels*. Moderate surpluses resulting from efficient batching (e.g., MPF 5-crate minimums) or proactive gathering/refining are acceptable and often beneficial, providing resilience against demand spikes or disruptions. The system prioritizes avoiding shortages over strictly adhering to exact buffer numbers.

We approach this as designing a task management and workflow automation system overlayed on Foxhole's player-driven logistics.

**2\. Goals**

* **Map Core Logistics States:** Clearly define the relevant state transitions from raw resource acquisition through refining, production, storage, and delivery, accounting for different methods and locations.  
* **Implement Bot-Managed Pull Flow:** Design a system where reported needs generate prioritized tasks (Gathering, Refining, Production, Transport) within Discord, clarifying the logic for each pull level down to resource acquisition if necessary.  
* **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce delivery latency, minimize waste, maximize throughput (using standardized loads and batching incentives), and ensure high availability of critical resources via buffer management.  
* **Achieve Strategic Objective:** Support capturing/holding hexes by ensuring sustained supply lines.  
* **Maximize Player Effectiveness:** Provide a clear task management system, improving coordination, resource allocation, guiding players, and managing the distinct workflows from resource gathering to final delivery.

**3\. Core Logistics Workflow (Relevant States & Task Phases)**

This outlines the lifecycle of supplies as tracked or managed by the bot. 'In Transit' and 'Queued' phases are represented by Bot Task statuses.

1. **`RAW_FIELD`** (State: Raw Resource Available) \- Resources available at fields/mines. *Implicit starting state.*  
2. **`GATHERING_IN_PROGRESS`** (Phase: Gathering Task Active) \- Represented by a `CLAIMED` `GATHER_RESOURCE` Task.  
3. **`RAW_STORED`** (State: Raw Materials Stored) \- Raw resources delivered to a Refinery or Storage Hub. Tracked via `!stock report`. Source for Refining.

16. **`STORED_FORWARD_BASE`** (State: Delivered to Forward Base) \- Goods delivered to final destination. Tracked via `!stock report`.

**4\. Refined Pull-Based Logistics Model (Discord Bot Driven)**

This model translates reported needs into actionable, prioritized tasks, potentially cascading down to resource gathering. FTL=15 crates, FCL=60 crates.

* **Level 1 Pull: Forward Base Demand (Last Mile)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low stock in `STORED_FORWARD_BASE` state vs buffer, or `!request`. Requires `--source [FrontlineHubName]`.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit, rounds up to FTL. Checks `STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` stock at source.  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `TRANSPORT_LAST_MILE` task if source stock sufficient.  
* **Level 2 Pull: Frontline Staging Point Demand (Bulk Supply)**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Low stock in `STORED_FRONTLINE_HUB` state vs buffer, `!request`, or Level 1 failure.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates deficit, rounds up to FCL/FTL. Performs Critical Ping check. Triggers Level 3\.  
  * **Output Action:** Initiates Level 3 check/task generation.  
* **Level 3 Pull: Backline Production/Transport Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Deficit calculated at Level 2 for a Frontline Hub.  
  * **Logic:** Prioritizes need. Checks `STORED_BACKLINE` stock for finished goods.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If stock found: Generate `TRANSPORT` task.  
    * If no stock found: Trigger Level 0 Pull (Material Check).  
* **Level 0 Pull: Material Demand for Production**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level 3 determines production is needed (`QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task required).  
  * **Logic:** Checks availability of required refined materials (`REFINED_STORED` state) at or near the chosen production location (Factory/MPF). Requires `!stock report` data for relevant locations.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If materials sufficient: Generate `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task (Factory/MPF specific batches) and provide feasibility notice/estimate.  
    * If materials insufficient locally, check other `REFINED_STORED` locations: Generate `TRANSPORT_REFINED` task to move materials to the production site *before* the `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` task can start (or mark production task as blocked).  
    * If materials insufficient globally: Trigger Level \-1 Pull (Refining Demand).  
* **Level \-1 Pull: Refining Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level 0 requires refined materials that are not available.  
  * **Logic:** Calculates required raw materials based on recipes. Checks availability of raw materials (`RAW_STORED` state) at or near Refineries. Requires `!stock report` data for raw materials.  
  * **Output Action:**  
    * If raw materials sufficient: Generate `QUEUE_REFINING` task at a Refinery. Assign priority based on the ultimate production need. User needs to update completion time.  
    * If raw materials insufficient locally, check other `RAW_STORED` locations: Generate `TRANSPORT_RAW` task to move raw materials to the Refinery *before* the `QUEUE_REFINING` task can start.  
    * If raw materials insufficient globally: Trigger Level \-2 Pull (Gathering Demand).  
* **Level \-2 Pull: Resource Gathering Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Level \-1 requires raw materials that are not available.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies specific raw resource needed (Scrap, Components, Sulfur, etc.) and quantity.  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `GATHER_RESOURCE` task (e.g., `GATHER_RESOURCE Scrap [Qty] [TargetRefinery/Hub]`). Assigns priority. Players claim and manually complete this task.  
* **Level 4 Pull: Production Pickup Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Completion of `QUEUE_PRODUCTION`. Items in `PRODUCTION_READY` state.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies completed run. Determines destination (default: Backline Hub).  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `PICKUP_PRODUCTION` task. Notifies role on MPF completion.  
* **Level 5 Pull: Refining Pickup Demand**  
  * **Input Trigger:** Completion of `QUEUE_REFINING` (timed). Items in `REFINING_READY` state.  
  * **Logic:** Identifies completed run. Determines destination (default: Backline Hub, potentially direct to Production if linked).  
  * **Output Action:** Generates `PICKUP_REFINED` task. Notifies role on completion (optional).

**5\. Discord Bot Implementation Details**

* **A. Command Interface:**  
  * **New/Updated Commands:**  
    * `!config set_refinery_complete_ping [Role]` \- (Admin) Optional ping for refinery completion.  
    * `!tasks create gather [ResourceType] [Quantity] [TargetHub/Refinery]` \- (User/Admin) Manually create gathering task.  
    * `!tasks create refine [MaterialType] [Quantity] [RefineryLocation]` \- (User/Admin) Manually create refining task. Requires subsequent `!tasks update ... set_completion_time`.  
    * `!tasks update [TaskID] set_completion_time [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` \- (User, claimer) **Now used for both MPF and Refinery** `QUEUE_...` tasks.  
    * `!stock report`: Scope potentially expands to include raw/refined materials at Hubs/Refineries. Requires clear location naming.  
    * `!tasks list/find`: Updated to show/filter new task types (`GATHER_RESOURCE`, `QUEUE_REFINING`, `PICKUP_REFINED`, `TRANSPORT_RAW`, `TRANSPORT_REFINED`) and related activities.  
  * *(Other commands as previously specified)*  
* **B. Priority Queue Logic:** Handles priorities cascading down from high-level needs to potentially low-level gathering tasks.  
* **C. Task Management:**  
  * Adds new TaskTypes.  
  * `QUEUE_REFINING` tasks need `EstimatedCompletionTime`.  
  * Background process handles timeouts and auto-completion for both MPF and Refinery queues.  
  * Dependency Management: `QUEUE_PRODUCTION` tasks might be blocked pending `TRANSPORT_REFINED` or Level \-1/-2 tasks. `QUEUE_REFINING` might be blocked pending `TRANSPORT_RAW` or Level \-2 tasks. Status should reflect blocks.  
* **D. Production & Transport Logic:**  
  * Implements full pull logic (Level 3 down to \-2).  
  * Includes prerequisite checks for materials before queuing production/refining.  
  * Acknowledges preference for direct use (e.g., Refinery \-\> Factory) but may default to simpler storage steps initially.  
* **E. Encouraging Moderation:** Feasibility notices now reflect potential delays down to resource gathering.  
* **F. Conceptual Data Model:**  
  * `Hubs`: Includes Refineries, potentially Resource Fields.  
  * `HubStockStatus`: Needs to track Raw and Refined materials in addition to produced goods. Requires robust item/material naming convention.  
  * `Tasks`: Adds new TaskTypes, potentially `BlockedByTaskID` field for dependencies. `EstimatedCompletionTime` used for Refining queues too.  
  * `Recipes`: Needs to include Raw \-\> Refined recipes.  
  * `GlobalConfig`: Add `RefineryCompletionPingRole`.  
* **G. Completion Rate Calculation:** Logic applies to new task types as well.

**6\. Information Flow & Communication (Bot Mediated)**

Bot manages the potentially deep dependency chain from final product request back to resource need, providing visibility and task management throughout.

**7\. Optimization Strategies (Bot Enabled)**

* Optimizing the Refinery \-\> Factory flow is a key area.  
* Proactive gathering/refining based on anticipated needs (driven by dashboard/status).

**8\. Metrics for Success (Bot Trackable)**

* Track completion rates/times for Gathering and Refining tasks.  
* Monitor frequency of tasks being blocked by material/resource shortages.  
* Measure end-to-end time from initial request to final delivery across all levels.

**9\. Risks and Challenges (Bot Context)**

* **Increased Data Dependency:** System effectiveness heavily relies on accurate and frequent `!stock report` data for raw/refined materials at multiple location types. This is a major challenge.  
* **Complexity:** Managing the multi-level dependencies and potential blocking states significantly increases bot complexity.  
* **User Input:** Requires users to reliably update completion times for Refining queues.  
* **Bottleneck Identification:** While highlighting shortages, resolving deep bottlenecks (e.g., lack of Sulfur) still requires significant player coordination outside the bot's direct control.

**10\. Conclusion**

This comprehensive design integrates resource gathering and refining into the pull-based logistics model. By creating tasks that cascade down to the most basic resource needs when necessary, the bot provides end-to-end visibility and coordination potential. However, this significantly increases the system's complexity and its reliance on accurate, widespread inventory reporting by users. The acceptance of surpluses and focus on avoiding shortages guides the overall logistics strategy facilitated by the bot.
